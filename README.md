This project was the final project for my CS50 course. 

Welcome to Birthday Cards!

This website is designed to allow users to document their friends’ birthdays and send cards to them when the special day comes. This project compiles when running flask in the terminal of the CS50 IDE.

There are 4 main components to our website. First, the user can input their friends’ birthdays in the ‘Add a Birthday’ page of our website. This page also prompts the user for the email addresses of their friends so that they can send cards to them through the site. Once birthdays have been added, they get displayed on our special birthday calendar for users to browse through. Every year, the birth dates inputted into the site will be displayed for the current year. If the month of the friend’s birthday has passed, their birthday will show up in the calendar for the next year. If the user is browsing through their friends’ birthdays of the year on the calendar, they can click the “today” button to go back to the display of the present date.

On the day of a friend’s birthday, our site allows the user to send a customized birthday card to them through email. Available card templates can be browsed on the ‘Available Card Templates’ page. Once the user has chosen a card template, they can go back to the index page and click the ‘Create a Card!’ button to fill out a form that allows them to choose the friend they would like to send a card to, choose a template, and write a personalized message. Clicking the ‘Send Card’ button will then automatically send the personalized card to the friend’s email address.

Our website allows extra features for special VIP members. In order to become a VIP, users must go to the ‘Register as VIP’ page and submit a screenshot proving that they donated to a charity organization of our page. Once submitted, they are expected to wait 3-5 business days for one of us to review and accept their application. If accepted, users will have access to a card option that allows them to choose an image of their choice by providing a URL. In order to try this special feature, here is an approved VIP account that you can login through to view:
username: VIP
Password: welcome!

When users submit a VIP application by submitting the screenshot, that screenshot gets put into a folder in our IDE called submissions. Shelly and I view these screenshots and then log into our own accounts to manually approve the user. This approval process can only be done through our accounts. In order to view the application approval page, you can login through one of our accounts:
Username: shelly
Password: 123

The username and password to the yaybirthdaycards@gmail.com email is:

Thank you for visiting our site! We hope you had a nice experience.
